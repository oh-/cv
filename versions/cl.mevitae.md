<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->

Dear Ms Satti,

I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Interests and personal projects

<!-- AIM: Briefly describe project.  -->
<!-- AIM: Describe my interest, showing my understanding -->
I am interested in the area of machine learning and AI, and I think its applications will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. I have been keeping up to date with projects and startups using deep learning and neural networks like DeepMind's AlphaGo. And in my spare time I am investigating use cases for ML in personal projects; one currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relevant data-points.

<!-- AIM: what do I think they do, and how my interest/project might fit in... what I can bring -->
<!--

-->
I believe that equality in the workforce is still a big problem today, and to using ML and AI to help deal with issues like implicit bias is a ground-breaking approach to help with it. 


To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I am excited by the prospect of being able to learn more in this area, and I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
