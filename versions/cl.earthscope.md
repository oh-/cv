<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Interests and personal projects

<!-- AIM: Briefly describe project.  -->
<!-- AIM: Describe my interest, showing my understanding -->
I am interested in machine learning, deep neural networks and AI, and I have been keeping up to date with the exciting endeavours of projects like DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar. I think that these techniques will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research.  And while I don't yet have an abundance of experience using machine learning; in my spare time I am investigating ML by using it in personal projects. One currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relavent data-points.

<!-- AIM: what do I think they do, and how my interest/project might fit in... what I can bring -->

I can see the potential of ML, and why the field is currently a hot-spot for innovation. I can envisage how Earthscope might be using it by implamenting computer vision to process satellite images to reveal trends in food production and supply (also open to many different areas hear), which in turn, could then be passed to a quantisation algorithm and used to predict current trends in a wide variety of industries, which previously required much hands on analytical work.

<!-- mention analytical work of predicting things from First python project) -->

I believe that the area of food production predictors would just be the beginning


Computer Vision:

Training a image processing neural network to recognise particular points relevant to the area of interest - in the case of food, that could be how well crops are doing as viewed from a satellite images. Using similar models, relevant markers for other markets would also be able to go through similar processes: whereby Neural networks are trained to recognise how well a particular indicator is doing.

This information would then be transferred to various analysis algorithms, and when combined with historical pricing, or timing or levels could be used

 - and using this information to feed other algorithms which would match the prediction to an outcome (or likely outcome).


I guess that


 for uncovering the global production of food and linking those insights to supply chains.

scoping the way for new industries, to predict important {data leader points:points that using this technology are able to lead to predictions}

<!-- I am also interested in game engines as a framework for pushing machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - for example DeepMind’s AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar. I think that deep learning engines will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. -->

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
