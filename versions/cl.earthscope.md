<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Interests and personal projects

<!-- AIM: Briefly describe project.  -->
<!-- AIM: Describe my interest, showing my understanding -->
I am interested in the area of machine learning and AI, and I think it will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. I have been keeping up to date with projects and startups using deep learning and neural networks like DeepMind's AlphaGo. And in my spare time I am investigating how it uses ML in personal projects; one currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relevant data-points.

<!-- AIM: what do I think they do, and how my interest/project might fit in... what I can bring -->

I can envisage how Earthscope is might be train an image processing neural network on satellite images to recognise relevant data, including but not limited to food production, eg specific image colour changes could tell what kind of crop is grown, how much land / crop production.  This information would then be piped to various analysis algorithms, and when combined with historical pricing, or timing or crop yields could be used to predict highly accurate production values. I believe that the area of food production predictors would be just the beginning, and the techniques extensible into many different industries.

<!-- Computer Vision:
, to for uncovering the global production of food and linking those insights to supply chains.
- and using this information to feed other algorithms which would match the prediction to an outcome (or likely outcome).
scoping the way for new industries, to predict important {data leader points:points that using this technology are able to lead to predictions} -->
<!-- I am also interested in game engines as a framework for pushing machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - for example DeepMind’s AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar. I think that deep learning engines will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. -->

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I am excited by the prospect of being able to learn more in this area, and I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
