<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
Dear Ms Sawers,


I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Interests and personal projects

<!-- AIM: Briefly describe project.  -->
<!-- AIM: Describe my interest, showing my understanding -->
I am interested in the area of machine learning and AI, and I think its applications will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. I have been keeping up to date with projects and startups using deep learning and neural networks like DeepMind's AlphaGo. And in my spare time I am investigating use cases for ML in personal projects; one currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relevant data-points.

<!-- AIM: what do I think they do, and how my interest/project might fit in... what I can bring -->

I can envisage how Earth-i might be using ML and AI techniques such as computer vision and neural networks to recognise and label relevant data in images, and using that information to predict things like food production, sourcing and labelling satellite imagery of mapped farming areas over regular periods of time, predicting which crops and varietals are being grown based on image pixel colour and seasonal changes, then predicting how much crop production based on land size.  This information could then be piped to analysis algorithms, and when combined with historical pricing, or timing or crop yields could be used to predict valuable information like highly accurate production volumes, and the techniques extensible into many different industries.

<!-- Computer Vision:
, to for uncovering the global production of food and linking those insights to supply chains.
- and using this information to feed other algorithms which would match the prediction to an outcome (or likely outcome).
scoping the way for new industries, to predict important {data leader points:points that using this technology are able to lead to predictions} -->
<!-- I am also interested in game engines as a framework for pushing machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - for example DeepMind’s AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar. I think that deep learning engines will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. -->

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I am excited by the prospect of being able to learn more in this area, and I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
