<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
Dear Ms Wyniawskyj,

I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Interests and personal projects

<!-- AIM: Briefly describe project.  -->
<!-- AIM: Describe my interest, showing my understanding -->
I am interested in the area of machine learning and AI, and I think its applications will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. I have been keeping up to date with projects and startups using deep learning and neural networks like DeepMind's AlphaGo. And in my spare time I am investigating use cases for ML in personal projects; one currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relevant data-points.

<!-- AIM: what do I think they do, and how my interest/project might fit in... what I can bring -->

I am particularly interested in the *ExoMars* project at Deimos Space, which combines machine learning with risk analysis to for control and safety systems.  I can envisage how Deimos might be using ML and AI techniques such as computer vision and neural networks to optimise such things as flight paths and fuel consumption.


To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I am excited by the prospect of being able to learn more in this area, and I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
