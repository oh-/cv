**DeepMind**

DeepMind is the world leader in artificial intelligence research and its
application for positive impact. We're on a scientific mission to push
the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any
complex problem without needing to be taught how.

If we're successful, we believe this will be one of the most important
and widely beneficial scientific advances ever made, increasing our
capacity to understand the mysteries of the universe and to tackle some
of our most pressing real-world challenges, from climate change to
radically improved healthcare.

At DeepMind we have a myriad of teams such as Robotics, Science, 
Fundamental Research and the Research Platform Team who will all be
welcoming Interns in 2019 for durations of 14 - 20 consecutive weeks.

**The Role**

As a Research Engineering intern at DeepMind, you will use your software
engineering skills to advance our pioneering AI research programme in
collaboration with other members of the research team.

Our research presents a large range of interesting and unique
engineering challenges:

-   Innovating in the organisation of large-scale distributed machine
    learning systems.
-   Taking research advances in optimisation or learning algorithms and
    making them easy to use for all our research groups.
-   Working out how to make best use of high-performance computing
    platforms such as GPUs and TPUs.
-   Implementing innovative reinforcement learning agent architectures
    and learning algorithms.
-   Designing and implementing environments and challenges for our
    agents, or making third-party or real-world environments available
    for research use.
-   Measuring agent performance and analysing agent behaviour on a
    variety of tasks.

Engineering intern projects may involve working as part of a research
team focused on a single research problem, or as part of a team building
tools and platforms used across a number of our research efforts.
Whatever project you work on, you will be part of a diverse and
interdisciplinary team of highly talented people.

**About you**

We welcome applications from people currently studying for a degree of
any level (Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate) in a technical subject
(computer science, engineering, maths, physics, etc.) who have some
software engineering experience. No prior experience of AI or machine
learning is necessary.

**\*\* Applications are open from 4 - 18th February 2019. Unfortunately,
we are unable to accept any applications made after the 18th February.
