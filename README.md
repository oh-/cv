I am a third year undergraduate student in Physics at Queen Mary
University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and
software engineering. I have a diverse history of experience with a
background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working
collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing,
motion and dance. I have also been a freelance software developer,
leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design. I
have recently undertaken two interships: \* A space engineering company,
as part of the earth observation team, where I used python, keras and
TensorFlow to create an object detection model, and researching other
machine learning and computer vision techniques. \* A software
engineering intern for a fintech startup, and where I used Django to
create an OpenBanking service client, and learned about how to build a
django web app.

I am searching for an opportunity to develop my skills in machine
learning and software development, where I would be part of a team
involved in projects using and exploring such areas in ML as computer
vision and transfer learning. I would like be able to use my creative
background along with my analytical skills to develop and enhance
software projects in a modern and innovative environment.

### 2018 Software engineering internship. {#software-engineering-internship}

During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering
internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have
created a lean cloud based banking platform. I was delegated to the API
/ integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an
internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking
initiative the OpenBanking API. The client that I wrote had to conform
to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth
bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven
development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written
using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest.

As part of team building, I delivered a company presentation on my
research into OpenBanking. And for project planning, I took part in a
daily morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set
my own goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration.

### Research projects and education. {#research-projects-and-education}

Throughout my degree, I have been learning techniques in mathematics,
programming, and physical laws to interrogate, model and analyse data
from physical systems.

During the module *Introduction to Scientific Computing*, we used Python
and Jupyter Notebooks to model mathematical functions and analyse
datasets; extracting relevant physical information from them. Of note,
we learned about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and
image manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which
drew upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I researched and wrote a
scientific report analysing gravitational waves and black hole mergers,
which included an analysis of the first confirmed merger. I used the
public data-set from the LIGO interferometers, which measure stellar
mass black-hole mergers, and I used python, numpy and scipy, in a
Jupyter notebook to analyse the data. I used discrete Fourier transforms
to clean the signals, and a linear regression to fit Einsteinian
prediction about the merger, for example: the mass of each of the two
black holes, and producing a 'chirp mass' graph for that particular
event.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python
and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World
Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific
and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the
results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables
throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.

### Freelance web development experience. {#freelance-web-development-experience}

Before commencing my Msci at Queen Mary, I worked as a freelance web
developer, where I used my creative background to design and build
custom website themes and plugins, gaining experience in PHP,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

From 2016, I worked as lead web developer for *Stillnessinyoga*, a dutch
yoga and meditation studio. I built a web platform for their digital
product, which has become an industry leading, online learning space
that accompanies their teacher trainings. The site included a content
restricted membership area, with e-commerce checkout, and a media
streaming platform to present secure video content hosted in a private
Amazon S3 buckets.

Along with designing the interactive digital teacher training manuals. I
worked along side head teachers to design and put together three teacher
training manuals (Level 1, 2, Advanced 2) - in iBook format - an
interactive e-publishing book format.
