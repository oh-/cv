### 2008 Software engineering internship.
<!-- The “Hard Sell” Paragraph – Prove how qualified you are. Use bullet points to highlight achievements.  -->

During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have created a lean cloud based banking platform.  I was delegated to the API / integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking initiative the OpenBanking API.  The client that I wrote had to conform to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest.

As part of team building, I gave a company presentation on my research into OpenBanking.  And for project planning, I took part in a daily morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set my own goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration.

### Research projects and education.

Overall skill review for Uni:

Throughout my degree, I have been learning techniques in mathematics, programming, and physical laws to interrogate, model and analyse data from physical systems.

During the module _Introduction to Scientific Computing_, we were taught how to model many mathematical functions and analyse datasets; extracting relevant physical information from them.  Of note, we learned about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and image manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which drew upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I used the researched and analysed gravitational waves, using the public data-set from the LIGO interferometers.  Using Fourier transform to clean the signals, and a linear regression to fit.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.

### Freelance web development experience.

Before commencing my undergraduate study at Queen Mary, I worked as a freelance web developer, where I used my creative background to design and build custom website themes and plugins, gaining experience in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. This lead to working as the lead developer for *Stillnessinyoga*, a dutch yoga and meditation studio, where I built their digital product which has become an industry leading online learning space to accompany their teacher trainings for students to become certified yoga and meditation teachers.

I built the online membership e-commerce platform, along with designing the interactive digital teacher training manuals. I integrated a media streaming platform to host secure video content, integrating Amazon S3 buckets.
