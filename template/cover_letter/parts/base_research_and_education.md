Throughout my degree, I have been learning techniques in mathematics, programming, and physical laws to interrogate, model and analyse data from physical systems.

During the module _Introduction to Scientific Computing_, we were taught how to model many mathematical functions and analyse datasets; extracting relevant physical information from them.  Of note, we learned about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and image manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which drew upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I researched and wrote a scientific report analysing gravitational waves and black hole mergers, which included an analysis of the first confirmed merger, detection GW151226. I used the public data-set from the LIGO interferometers, which measure stellar mass black-hole mergers, and I used python, numpy and scipy, in a Jupyter notebook to analyse the data.  I used Fourier transforms to clean the signals, and a linear regression to fit Einsteinian prediction about the merger, for example: the mass of each of the two black holes, and producing a 'chirp mass' graph for that particular event.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.
