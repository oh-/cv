### 2019 SEPNet Internship: Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
<!-- The “Hard Sell” Paragraph – Prove how qualified you are. Use bullet points to highlight achievements.  -->
In the 2019 Summer break, I took part in the South-Eastern Physics Network (SEPNet) internship programme, joining the Earth Observation team at Deimos Space UK; a satellite and space engineering company at the Harwell Science and Technology Campus in Oxfordshire. There, the team use machine learning on high resolution satellite imagery to produce object detection models that extract resources and information which is pipelined to products and industry partners.

and learning about the UK space industry, and how machine learning and computer vision is being used to produce useful information from satellite imagery.

<!-- The application that I wrote -->
I lead an investigative project to produce object detection models that could differentiate between various types of vegetation and biodiversity; each model producing a heat-map, hi-lighting regions of high detection density of a particular biodiversity class. It would be used by their farming industry partners, with the aim to reduce chemical usage by informing them of optimal areas to target the resources.

<!-- For the pipeline that I created,  -->
I used python and libraries Keras, TensorFlow, PIL, pandas, and numpy to batch process the labelled images, and then trained the model on them using a dedicated high power GPU server. The trained model could then used to classify a stream of images on the fly, or saved for later use further down in the partner pipeline.

Within the project remit, it was specified that there would be a limited availability of labelled source imagery; so I researched and implemented methods of transfer learning; increasing the feature extraction accuracy and and decreased training time (when comparing to the same dataset without using transfer learning).

in order to train the models on a smaller dataset, while continuing to have

in neural networks, and implemented one in a project constrained by a limited labelled dataset; improving training time. -->



<!--
I took part in several projects:

- Built object detection model for earth observation data, to detect and differentiate between biodiversity types (Python, TensorFlow and Keras).
- Researched methods of transfer learning in neural networks, and implemented one in a project constrained by a limited labelled dataset; improving training time.
-->
<!--
- Created internal reference documentation for CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool).
 -->
<!--
- Collaborated on a poster researching computer vision methods using machine learning, neural networks and transfer learning.
 -->
At the end project I produced a report and research poster, presenting my findings and results at the SEPNet presentation day, along with my collaborator.

<!--
During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have created a lean cloud based banking platform.  I was delegated to the API / integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking initiative the OpenBanking API.  The client that I wrote had to conform to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest.
-->

<!--
As part of team building, I delivered a company presentation on my research into OpenBanking.  And for project planning, I took part in a daily morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set my own goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration.
