### 2019 Machine Learning and Computer Vision internship
<!-- The “Hard Sell” Paragraph – Prove how qualified you are. Use bullet points to highlight achievements.  -->
In the 2019 Summer break, I joined the Earth Observation team at Deimos Space UK, a satellite and space engineering company in Harwell, Oxfordshire.

The team use machine learning to create object detection models from satellite imagery, which are pipelined to produce rich information for industry partners.

I lead an investigative project using python, TensorFlow and Keras, to produce an object detection model differentiating between various types of vegetation, creating a heat-map like image, which could be used to (**give back farmers useful information**)

I used python to automate and batch process labelled images, creating a pipeline to train the model on a given set of images; which would be used by the industry partner to upload the images, and


 with the aim that it would feed this information back into the application pipeline to serve back to industry partner, who would use
 and learning about the UK space industry, and how machine learning and computer vision is being used to produce useful information from satellite imagery.  

I took part in several projects:

- Built object detection model for earth observation data, to detect and differentiate between biodiversity types (Python, TensorFlow and Keras).
- Researched methods of transfer learning in neural networks, and implemented one in a project constrained by a limited labelled dataset; improving training time.
- Created internal reference documentation for CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool).
- Collaborated on a poster researching computer vision methods using machine learning, neural networks and transfer learning.

<!-- During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have created a lean cloud based banking platform.  I was delegated to the API / integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking initiative the OpenBanking API.  The client that I wrote had to conform to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest. -->

<!-- As part of team building, I delivered a company presentation on my research into OpenBanking.  And for project planning, I took part in a daily morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set my own goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration. -->
