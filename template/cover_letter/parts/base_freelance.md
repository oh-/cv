### Freelance web development experience.

Before commencing my Msci at Queen Mary, I worked as a freelance web developer, where I used my creative background to design and build custom website themes and plugins, gaining experience in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

From 2016, I worked as lead web developer for *Stillnessinyoga*, a dutch yoga and meditation studio.  I built a web platform for their digital product, which has become an industry leading, online learning space that accompanies their teacher trainings. The site included a content restricted membership area, with e-commerce checkout, and a media streaming platform to present secure video content hosted in a private Amazon S3 buckets.

Along with designing the interactive digital teacher training manuals. I worked along side head teachers to design and put together three teacher training manuals (Level 1, 2, Advanced 2) - in iBook format - an interactive e-publishing book format.
