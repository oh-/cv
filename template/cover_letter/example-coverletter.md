<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am writing to express my interest in the *Researching Engineering Internship* programme you will be running at DeepMind this summer.  I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.

### Personal objective.

Machine learning is, and will continue to be an important aide for scientists and researchers, enabling us to look deeper into data heavy problems.  My software engineering, freelance, and creative experiences, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking research in machine learning, deep learning and AI.
