<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am a second year undergraduate student in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance web developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design, and most recently a software engineering intern.
