I believe that machine learning is, and will continue to be an important aide for scientists and researchers, enabling us to look deeper into data heavy problems,
utilising machine learning, deep neural networks and AI to improve our ability to analyse data by recognising patterns and behaviours that might otherwise go unnoticed.  I would love to be part of the team working towards these goals, where I can combine my diverse history in creativity, software engineering, and scientific research giving me an unique perspective in solving problems in machine learning.

I believe that I would be an ideal candidate for undertaking this internship, and that I would be able to add much in collaborating with a team of like minded individuals.
