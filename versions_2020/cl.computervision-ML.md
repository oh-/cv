<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am a graduating physics student in my third and final year at Queen Mary University of London. My major focus has been on theoretical and mathematical modules, and my final dissertation subject is on exploring new and novel methods of calculating scattering amplitudes.

I have a diverse history of experience with a background in Photography where I have been part of many creative collaborations, exhibitions and projects. I have been a freelance web developer; leading creative front-end and graphic design projects. Most recently, over the past two summer breaks of my physics undergrad, I have been selected for two internships: one in software development for a fin-tech startup, and the other, as part of the SEPNet programme, in machine learning and computer vision at a space engineering
